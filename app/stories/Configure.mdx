    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <span>
      <strong>UI-Kit</strong> is a centralized, living Storybook environment built for the
      web platform. It provides a single source of truth for all reusable
      <code>shadcn/ui</code>-based components, enabling the team to design, build, test, and
      document UI elements in complete isolation from the main web application.
    </span>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <h3>🧩 For Frontend Developers</h3>
    <span>
      Develop, debug, and visually test UI components in an isolated environment without needing to
      spin up the full application. Each component includes usage examples, props documentation, and
      interaction tests.
    </span>

    <h3>🎨 For UI/UX Designers</h3>
    <span>
      Explore and review interactive components independently, validate their look, feel, and
      behavior, and ensure design consistency across all features before integration.
    </span>

    <h3>📋 For Product Owners</h3>
    <span>
      Maintain a standardized component library and documentation space that accelerates onboarding
      for new developers and ensures long-term scalability of the UI system.
    </span>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <span>
      The <strong>UI-Kit</strong> is the foundation for a scalable, consistent, and
      maintainable design system. It bridges development and design through shared, documented, and
      tested components—ensuring every UI element in products feels cohesive and reliable.
